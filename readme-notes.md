# README Generator

## Description

I was given the task of creating a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input. It is important to have a README for applications that explain what the app is for, how to use the app, and how to install it. Also, a README file informs users how to report issues and how to make contributions. During the building process of this application, I learned how to us inquirer, json packages and node modules to quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line interface.

## Usage

To use this application, be sure to download and install node.js. Specifically, the inquirer package included in node.js is required to run this application. Once the index.js file is opened in the CLI, type "node index.js" to initialize the application. You will be presented with multiple questions regarding the information you would like to be included in your README document. You will be prompted to provide the Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contribution Info, Tests, and Contact Details for your project. Once entering all of the information, a README.md file will appear within your project folder with all of the provided data, created dynamically.
